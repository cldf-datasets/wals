## [v2020.1] - 2021-04-13

Fleshed out the CLDF data to contain everything that's needed to feed
https://wals.info.

See
https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals/compare/v2020...v2020.1
for details.

## [v2020] - 2020-03-27

Minor corrections.

See https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals/milestone/2?closed=1
for a list of addressed issues.


## [v2014]

Three value assignments have been corrected and small corrections have been made to the classification mainly triggered by updates in Glottolog's classification.


## [v2013]

Several datapoints have been removed (typically because they had been assigned to the wrong language, thus they show up as additions above).


## [v2011]

- There are two new chapters (chapter 143 on Order of Negative Morpheme and Verb, and chapter 144 on Position of Negative Word With Respect to Subject, Object, and Verb, both with many new maps)
- Additional features have been added to some chapters.
- The genealogical classification of languages, including genera, has been updated.
- The one-to-many relationship between chapters and features/maps is now clearly reflected in the structure of WALS: A single chapter can contain not just one feature, but several features, most often two (e.g. feature 39A and feature 39B), but sometimes (with the new chapters 143 and 144) quite a few features and maps.
- For some of the features, WALS now includes examples supplied by the authors (for example feature 113A)
- WALS Online now contains the long introduction chapter of the printed atlas from 2005

### Language classification/name errors

- Johari: should be Tibeto-Burman (Bodic genus) (not Indo-European, Indic genus) without Ethnologue link.
- Gadaba: should be called “Gutob” (this is not a real error, but the name “Gadaba” for this Munda language is confusing because there is also a Dravidian language by the name “Gadaba”)
- Mikarew: should be in genus 53.5 (Mikarew), not in 53.3 (Lower Ramu)

["I am indebted to Harald Hammarström for helpful advice leading
to many of the revisions here from the Genealogical Language
List ..."]


### Feature description error/omission

The text for feature 40 (”Exclusive/Inclusive Distinction in Verbal Inflection”) does not mention that only person affixes in “subject” function have been taken into account.


### Typos

- p. 286: runáját > runájiet
- jacket back: demonstrativennoun and nounndemonstrative
- p. 367; examples 7a and 7b; ergative suffix: – e > -ɹe


### References in electronic version

All errors concern Sharma 1989a/b/c and Sharma 1992

- Tod:
  Lists the data source (for velar nasals) as Sharma 1989a, and lists the reference as Sharma 1989c, whereas in fact these should both be Sharma 1989b.
- Tinani and Gahri:
  The references listed are b and c, when it should only be b. And while the data source is correctly b for Matthew Dryer’s maps, for both it is incorrectly listed as a for the velar nasal map.
- Pattani:
  As with the last two, the references listed are b and c, when it should only be b. But this time it is right for velar nasal, but wrong for my maps, where (at least for some of them) it is listed as a.
- Spitian and Nyamkad:
  Two references are listed, a 1989d and a 1992. But these are the same source, and the correct year is 1992. There should be no 1989d. Furthermore the data source for chapter 9 (The Velar Nasal) is listed as 1989b. Matthew Dryer’s maps are correct as 1992.
- Jad:
  Here the data source (only on Matthew Dryer’s maps) and the reference are both listed as a, which are both wrong, since the source is c.
